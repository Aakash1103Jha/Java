# Learning Java

Documenting my journey, learning Java.

This repository contains the problems that I solve, from very simple and basic to more complex ones.

Right now, the ones that I have added here might seem quite basic and trivial, but the rule to learn something the right way is to take baby steps. But also, as Iron Man said,

so, from time to time, I might add some big problems.

## Why Am I Learning Java?

There is something weird that I have seen, ever since I got into the IT sector; somehow Java makes you more of a software engineer than any other programming language. Thus far, I've had a good taste of JS/TS/NodeJS, Python, React/React Native, Flutter, Swift, C#/ASP.NET, but I've been more inlined towards the world of JS/NodeJS. No offence to other languages/frameworks/libraries. I love JS. A friend of mine loves Dart/Flutter. So the answer to the why is, first, to prove myself (and especially the 2 years ago me) that I can learn and code in Java just as good as I do with JS/TS. And second, why not, it'll be fun. Haha!!

One of my friend started Java and I can say she did push me into getting started with Java as well.

### Thanks for stopping by.
