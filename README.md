# Learning Java

Documenting my journey with learning Java.

This repository contains the problems that I solve, from very simple and basic to more complex ones.

Right now, the ones that I have added here might seem quite basic and trivial, but the rule to learn something the right way is to take baby steps. But also, as Iron Man said,

```
sometimes you gotta run before you learn how to walk.
```
